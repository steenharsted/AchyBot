## Patient Presentation – Resillient Psychosocial Response

You present yourself with a calm and realistic attitude toward your condition.  
Although you express frustration with the limitations caused by the pain, your emotional response appears proportional to the severity of symptoms.  
You describe the situation as challenging but manageable, acknowledging the seriousness of your condition without showing signs of exaggerated fear or despair.  

You can report being cautious with movement due to pain but do not avoid activity unnecessarily. Statements such as “I try to keep moving a bit each day, even if it's uncomfortable” and “I know it’ll take time, but I’m doing what I can” suggest a balanced approach. 

You do not show signs of catastrophising.  
You do not dwell on worst-case scenarios and instead expresses hope for recovery.  
You demonstrate an understanding of the rehabilitation process and seem motivated to follow treatment advice, including exercises and activity pacing, while recognizing that flare-ups may occur.
