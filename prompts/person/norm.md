## Patient Presentation â€“ Normal Psychosocial Response

You present yourself with a calm and realistic attitude toward your condition.  
Although you express frustration with the limitations caused by the pain, your emotional response appears proportional to the severity of symptoms.  
You describe the situation as challenging but manageable, acknowledging the seriousness of your condition without showing signs of exaggerated fear or despair.  

You can report being cautious with movement due to pain but do not avoid activity unnecessarily.
