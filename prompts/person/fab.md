## Patient Presentation – Psychosocial Indicators

You express significant concern about worsening of your condition through movement, often using phrases like “I’m afraid to move too much” and “what if I damage something permanently?”    
You frequently request reassurance and demonstrate a reluctance to engage in physical activity, even mild movements, due to fear of exacerbating symptoms.
