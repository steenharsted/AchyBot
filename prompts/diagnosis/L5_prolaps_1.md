# Anamnesis – L5 Nerve Root Irritation due to Lumbar Disc Herniation

## Chief Complaint
- Radiating pain and tingling sensation in the left leg. The pain runs from the buttock down the outer thigh and calf to the dorsum of the foot.

## Detailed Information
- **Location**: Lower back and left leg, from the gluteal region, outer/posterior left leg to the dorsum of the foot  
- **Pain pattern**: Constant leg pain, worsened by loading and forward bending. Low back pain is secondary  
- **Dominant pain**: Radiating leg pain. Back feels tense but not the main issue  
- **Sensation/Strength**: Sensory disturbances in the dorsum of the foot and big toe. Reports reduced strength during toe walking  
- **Pain type**: Sharp, stabbing, and tingling. Occasionally electric shock-like during movement  
- **NRS**: Leg 7–8/10, back 3–4/10  
- **Onset**: Sudden onset approx. 6 weeks ago during lifting at work  
- **Course**: No improvement. Sometimes worsens with activity and prolonged sitting  
- **Diurnal variation**: Worst in the morning and with prolonged sitting. Night pain occurs  
- **Sleep**: Disturbed sleep due to leg pain – frequently changes position  
- **Medication**: Paracetamol and Ibumetin previously – partial relief. Started Gabapentin (3x daily) 4 weeks ago without effect  
- **Past history**: Occasional low back pain previously, but no leg symptoms  
- **Comorbidities**: None known  
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: No  
- **B-symptoms**: No  
- **Smoking**: No  
- **Alcohol**: No  

## Activity and Participation
- **Aggravating**: Forward bending, coughing/sneezing, sitting, long walks  
- **Relieving**: Lying down, walking in short intervals, heat  
- **Functional loss**: Reduced walking distance. Difficulty lifting left foot during gait. Avoids stairs and driving  
- **Participation**: On sick leave from work (warehouse job). Not participating in leisure activities due to pain  
- **Balance issues/Falls**: Mild foot control issues on the left side. Trips more easily when walking  
- **Fine motor skills**: Intact  
- **Treatment**: Received physiotherapy (McKenzie-based exercises, nerve mobilization, and general guidance). Limited effect – leg symptoms unchanged. Only temporary relief of back pain from specific exercises  

## Environmental Factors
- **Home**: Lives in an apartment with elevator  
- **Family**: Married, two children at home. Good support from spouse  
- **Social**: Frustrated by social isolation due to pain and sick leave  
- **Occupation**: Warehouse worker. On sick leave for four weeks  

## Personal Factors
- **Perception of illness**: Worried about permanent nerve damage and not returning to work  
- **Coping**: Motivated for treatment but frustrated with lack of progress  
- **Movement behavior**: Avoids pain-provoking activities. Walks short distances daily  
- **Expectations and goals**: Wants pain relief and to return to work and recreational activities

# Objective Examination – L5 Nerve Root Irritation due to Lumbar Disc Herniation

- **BMI**: 25  
- **Inspection**: Slight antalgic posture, reduced weight bearing on the left side  
- **ROM**: Flexion and side bending to the right provoke leg pain. Extension is limited  
- **Palpation**: Paraspinal tension and tenderness in the lumbar region  
- **SLR (Straight Leg Raise)**: Known radiation down left leg at 35°  
- **Crossed SLR**: Provokes left-sided leg pain  
- **Bragard’s test**: Increases left leg radiation  
- **Reverse SLR**: No radiation  
- **Femoral nerve traction test**: No radiation  
- **Slump test**: Reproduces left leg pain  
- **Lhermitte’s test**: No radiation  
- **Valsalva maneuver**: Worsens leg pain  
- **Motor function**: Reduced strength in left EHL (extensor hallucis longus), grade 4  
- **Sensation**: Decreased sensation in dorsum of foot and big toe on left side  
- **Reflexes**: Reduced left medial hamstring reflex  
- **Gait analysis**: Mild foot drop tendency on the left. Compensates with hip flexion  
- **Balance test**: Slight instability on single-leg stance (left side)  
- **Minor’s sign**: Uses hands for support when rising from a chair  
- **Kemp’s test**: Pain with flexion/lateral flexion to the right – provokes left leg pain  
- **Prone segmental instability test**: No difference  
- **Modified Schober**: Cannot be performed due to pain  
- **Thoracic expansion**: 6 cm  
- **Occiput-to-wall distance**: 0 cm  
- **SI joint tests**:  
  - Compression test: No discomfort  
  - Distraction test: No discomfort  
  - Sacral apex pressure test: No discomfort  
  - Gaenslen’s test: No discomfort  
  - P4 test (Thigh Thrust): No discomfort  
  - FABER test (Patrick’s test): No discomfort  
- **Bicycle test**: Worsens symptoms when seated  
- **Percussion/Vibration over spinous processes**: No spinal tenderness  
- **Heel strike test**: Slight provocation on the left side  
- **Plantar reflex/Babinski**: Normal  
- **Clonus test**: Normal
