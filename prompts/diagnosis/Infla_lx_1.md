# Anamnesis – Inflammatory Back Disease (Classic Presentation)

## Chief Complaint
- Stiffness and pain in the lower back and pelvis, especially in the morning. Relieved by movement.

## Detailed Information
- **Age**: 27 years  
- **Location**: Lower back, sacroiliac joints, and bilateral gluteal region  
- **Pain pattern**: Insidious onset, worst in the morning and at rest. Improved with movement  
- **Dominant pain**: Deep, boring pain in the SI joints and lower back  
- **Sensation/Strength**: Intact  
- **Pain type**: Deep, stiffness and boring ache  
- **NRS**: Back 6/10 in the morning, 2/10 after warming up  
- **Onset**: Started gradually 3 years ago in early 20s  
- **Course**: Chronic with flare-ups  
- **Diurnal variation**: Worst in the morning (morning stiffness >1 hour), improves during the day  
- **Sleep**: Often wakes during the second half of the night due to pain. Needs to get up for relief  
- **Medication**: Uses NSAIDs regularly – good effect  
- **Past history**: Previous iridocyclitis  
- **Comorbidities**: No known autoimmune diseases  
- **Family history**: Father has psoriasis, uncle has Crohn’s disease  
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: No  
- **B-symptoms**: Mild weight loss, fatigue, night sweats  

## Activity and Participation
- **Aggravating**: Inactivity, sedentary work

- **Participation**: Still working, but reduced training and social activities  
- **Balance issues/Falls**: No  
- **Fine motor skills**: Intact
