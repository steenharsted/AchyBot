# Anamnesis – Non-specific Low Back Pain / Piriformis Syndrome

## Chief Complaint
- Pain deep in the buttock area with radiation down the leg, especially when sitting or climbing stairs.

## Detailed Information
- **Location**: Deep gluteal, primarily on the left side. Radiation to the posterior thigh and calf, without muscle weakness  
- **Pain pattern**: Worsens with prolonged sitting, especially in the car and on hard chairs. Relieved by movement and stretching  
- **Dominant pain**: Buttock area – described as pressing and aching with sharp pain at the start of walking  
- **Sensation/Strength**: No objective deficits, but experiences fatigue and "heaviness" in the leg  
- **Pain type**: Deep, pressing, sharp with provocation  
- **NRS**: 7/10 after prolonged sitting, 2/10 at rest  
- **Onset**: Gradual onset 6 months ago after a period of increased running  
- **Course**: Fluctuating. Better after rest period but recurs with activity  
- **Diurnal variation**: Worst in the evening and after long periods of driving or office work  
- **Sleep**: Occasionally wakes when turning; discomfort when lying on the left side  
- **Medication**: Ibuprofen as needed – moderate effect. Tried Paracetamol with no noticeable effect  
- **Past history**: No previous similar pain. No known spinal conditions  
- **Comorbidities**: No systemic diseases. Former runner, inactive in recent months  
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: No  
- **B-symptoms**: No  

## Activity and Participation
- **Aggravating**: Sitting (driving, office work), stair climbing, deep squats, running  
- **Relieving**: Movement, stretching, heat, slow walking  
- **Functional loss**: Reduced ability to participate in sports (running, fitness). Withdrew from races  
- **Participation**: Limited participation in social activities involving prolonged sitting (cinema, travel, meetings)  
- **Balance issues/Falls**: No falls, but experiences imbalance/discomfort with unilateral movements  
- **Fine motor skills**: Intact  
- **Treatment**: Received physiotherapy including manual therapy (soft tissue treatment of piriformis and stretching) and stabilizing exercises for hip and pelvis. Also tried dry needling and a home stretching program. Moderate effect: Clear relief after treatment, but symptoms return with load. Tried to resume running but relapsed. Now uses foam roller, stretching, and heat daily with partial relief  

## Environmental Factors
- **Home**: Apartment without stairs  
- **Family**: Single, no children. Strong social network  
- **Social**: Participates in activities that don't require prolonged sitting  
- **Occupation**: IT consultant working from home – many hours at the computer  

## Personal Factors
- **Perception of illness**: Believes it's due to tension and overuse in the hip  
- **Coping**: Good understanding of the issue. Motivated to find solutions and follow exercises  
- **Movement behavior**: Avoids provoking activities, but tries to stay active through walking and light exercise  
- **Expectations and goals**: Wants to return to running and physical activity without symptoms – and be able to sit comfortably
