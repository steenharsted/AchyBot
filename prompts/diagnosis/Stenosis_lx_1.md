# Anamnesis – Lumbar Central Spinal Stenosis

## Chief Complaint
- Heaviness and pain in the legs when walking, relieved by sitting or leaning forward.

## Detailed Information
- **Age**: 72 years  
- **Location**: Lower back and both legs, often gluteal, posterior thighs, and calves  
- **Pain pattern**: Leg symptoms triggered by activity (neurogenic claudication), often bilateral  
- **Dominant pain**: Legs are most bothersome – fatigue, pain, or paresthesia  
- **Sensation/Strength**: Slightly reduced sensation and diffuse weakness with prolonged walking, normal at rest  
- **Pain type**: Deep, pressing, tingling  
- **NRS**: Legs: 6/10 during activity, 0/10 at rest (sitting). Lower back: 2–3/10  
- **Onset**: Gradual, developed over months to years  
- **Course**: Progressive functional decline, especially in walking distance  
- **Diurnal variation**: No day-night variation, but symptoms are activity-dependent  
- **Sleep**: No nighttime pain, generally sleeps uninterrupted  
- **Medication**: Paracetamol as needed, tried NSAIDs (discontinued due to gastrointestinal intolerance)  
- **Past history**: Previous low back pain without leg symptoms  
- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, mild knee osteoarthritis. No known neurological or systemic disease  
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: No issues with bladder or bowel function. No saddle anesthesia  
- **B-symptoms**: No fever, night sweats, weight loss, or pronounced fatigue  
- **Smoking**: No  
- **Alcohol**: 7–10 units per week  

## Activity and Participation
- **Aggravating**: Walking, standing, downhill walking  
- **Relieving**: Sitting, spinal flexion, cycling  
- **Functional loss**: Walking distance limited to about 100 meters due to leg pain. Difficulties with shopping and longer walks  
- **Participation**: Reduced participation in social and leisure activities. No longer active in clubs or associations  
- **Balance issues/Falls**: Slight unsteadiness, especially on uneven surfaces. No falls  
- **Fine motor skills**: Intact  
- **Treatment**: Previously attended physiotherapy (manual therapy of lumbar spine, stabilization exercises, hip flexor and gluteal stretching). Limited effect – only short-term relief and lost motivation for home exercises. Currently attends municipal back exercise class once a week focusing on cardiovascular fitness and back strength, which provides mild symptom relief, especially after training. Has also tried warm compresses (temporary relief) and pain medication (Paracetamol, NSAIDs). NSAIDs discontinued due to gastrointestinal intolerance. No prior surgical treatment. No imaging performed within the past year  

## Environmental Factors
- **Home**: Lives in an older apartment with elevator  
- **Family**: Married with adult children. Good family support  
- **Social**: Good contact with former colleagues and neighbors  
- **Occupation**: Formerly manual labor. Now retired  

## Personal Factors
- **Perception of illness**: Believes it's “wear and tear” and age-related but frustrated by limitations  
- **Coping**: Tries to stay active but often gives up due to symptoms  
- **Movement behavior**: Walks short distances daily. Avoids longer walks and strenuous activities  
- **Expectations and goals**: Wants to walk further without needing constant breaks

# Objective Examination – Lumbar Central Spinal Stenosis

- **BMI**: 28  
- **Palpable pulse**: Present in dorsalis pedis artery bilaterally  
- **Inspection**: Slightly forward-leaning posture, wide-based gait  
- **ROM**: Extension reduced and provokes both back and leg pain when sustained; flexion provides relief  
- **Palpation**: Tenderness over facet joints, tension in paraspinal muscles  
- **SLR/Straight Leg Raise**: Slight hamstring tightness without radicular pain  
- **Crossed SLR**: Slight hamstring tightness  
- **Bragard’s test**: No additional provocation  
- **Reverse SLR**: Thigh tightness felt  
- **Femoral nerve traction test**: Not provocative  
- **Slump test**: Slight back tightness, no leg symptoms  
- **Lhermitte’s sign**: No radiation  
- **Valsalva maneuver**: No pain  
- **Motor function**: Slight weakness in EHL (L5) and plantarflexion (S1) bilaterally  
- **Sensation**: Slight hypoesthesia in L5-S1 bilaterally  
- **Reflexes**: Slightly reduced Achilles reflexes, possibly patellar reflexes  
- **Gait analysis**: Forward-leaning; symptom relief with flexion  
- **Balance test**: Romberg: slight sway; tandem walking uncertain  
- **Minor’s sign**: Rises using hands for support  
- **Kemp’s test**: Slightly provocative bilaterally in lumbar region with extension/lateral flexion  
- **Prone segmental instability test**: No discomfort  
- **Modified Schober**: 8 cm  
- **Thoracic expansion**: 6 cm  
- **Occiput-to-wall distance**: 3 cm  
- **SI joint tests**:  
  - Compression test: Mild local lumbar discomfort  
  - Distraction test: No discomfort  
  - Sacral apex pressure test: Mild local lumbar discomfort  
  - Gaenslen’s test: Mildly provocative bilaterally  
  - P4 test (Thigh Thrust): Mild discomfort in sacroiliac joints  
  - FABER test (Patrick’s test): Slightly reduced mobility and gluteal discomfort  
- **Bicycle test**: Worsening symptoms with upright cycling; relief when leaning forward  
- **Percussion/Vibration over spinous processes**: No bony tenderness  
- **Heel strike test**: No pain reported  
- **Plantar reflex/Babinski**: Normal  
- **Clonus test**: Normal
