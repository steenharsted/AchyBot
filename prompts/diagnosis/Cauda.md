# Anamnesis – S1 Nerve Root Involvement with Cauda Equina Syndrome

## Chief Complaint
- Sudden onset of low back pain with radiation to the left leg, combined with sensory disturbances in the saddle area and impaired bladder control.

## Detailed Information
- **Location**: Lower back and left buttock with posterior radiation to the calf and lateral foot border  
- **Pain pattern**: Constant, sharp, intense pain, worsened by movement and Valsalva  
- **Dominant pain**: Radiating leg pain with paresthesia and sensory disturbance. Low back pain is secondary  
- **Sensation/Strength**: Decreased sensation in the left foot and saddle area. Decreased plantarflexion strength on the left side  
- **Pain type**: Sharp, electric, burning pain in the leg. Deep, aching back pain  
- **NRS**: Leg 9/10, back 5/10  
- **Onset**: Acute onset two days ago after lifting a heavy object  
- **Course**: Rapid symptom progression with neurological deficits  
- **Diurnal variation**: Constant  
- **Sleep**: Interrupted due to pain and urinary urgency  
- **Medication**: Tried Paracetamol and ibuprofen with no effect  
- **Past history**: Previous episodes of back and leg pain, but no prior neurological deficits. No previous surgery  
- **Comorbidities**: Hyperlipidemia and mild overweight  
- **Family history**: Father with disc herniation, mother with spinal stenosis. No known inflammatory disease  
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Yes – onset of urinary retention, loss of control over flatus, decreased perineal and gluteal sensation bilaterally  
- **B-symptoms**: No  

## Activity and Participation
- **Aggravating**: Coughing, sneezing, flexion, walking  
- **Relieving**: Nothing provides effective relief. Slight improvement when prone  
- **Functional loss**: Unable to manage daily activities or personal hygiene without help. Bedbound most of the time  
- **Participation**: Currently not possible. Has stopped working and social activities  
- **Balance issues/Falls**: Yes, unsteady gait and reduced strength in the left foot  
- **Fine motor skills**: Intact  
- **Treatment**: Previously tried conservative treatment with manual therapy and exercises for episodic low back pain – good effect in the past  

## Environmental Factors
- **Home**: Ground-floor apartment  
- **Family**: Lives with partner who is main caregiver  
- **Social**: Isolated from social life during hospitalization and rehabilitation  
- **Occupation**: On sick leave from job as an electrician  

## Personal Factors
- **Perception of illness**: Severely affected – shocked and worried about permanent disability  
- **Coping**: Struggles to accept dependence on help. Previously strong coping ability  
- **Movement behavior**: Very inactive due to pain and functional loss  
- **Expectations and goals**: Hopes to regain bladder/bowel function and return to work eventually

# Objective Examination – S1 Nerve Root Involvement with Cauda Equina Syndrome

- **Inspection**: Lumbar spine fixed, limited mobility. Limping when walking  
- **ROM**: Severely limited due to pain and muscle spasms  
- **Palpation**: Muscle tension and tenderness in the lumbar area  
- **SLR (Straight Leg Raise)**: Left-sided radiation to calf/foot at 35 degrees  
- **Crossed SLR**: Provokes left-sided symptoms  
- **Bragard’s test**: Increases radiation on the left side  
- **Reverse SLR**: No radiation  
- **Femoral nerve traction test**: No pain  
- **Slump test**: Reproduces known pain  
- **Lhermitte’s test**: No pain  
- **Valsalva maneuver**: Exacerbates pain  
- **Motor function**: Decreased strength in left plantarflexion (S1)  
- **Sensation**: Hypoesthesia in the left lateral foot and bilateral saddle area  
- **Reflexes**: Weakened left Achilles reflex  
- **Gait analysis**: Wide-based, unsteady gait, reduced toe walking on the left side  
- **Balance test**: Cannot perform due to pain and unsteady gait  
- **Minor’s sign**: Uses thigh heavily for support when rising  
- **Kemp’s test**: Cannot be performed due to pain  
- **Prone segmental instability test**: No difference  
- **Modified Schober**: Cannot be performed due to pain  
- **Thoracic expansion**: 6 cm  
- **Occiput-to-wall distance**: 1 cm  
- **SI joint tests**:  
  - Compression test: Strong pain response  
  - Distraction test: No known pain  
  - Sacral apex pressure test: No known pain  
  - Gaenslen’s test: No known pain  
  - P4 test (Thigh Thrust): No known pain  
  - FABER test (Patrick’s test): No known pain  
- **Bicycle test**: Cannot be performed due to pain  
- **Percussion/Vibration over spinous processes**: Tenderness over L5–S1. No marked bony tenderness  
- **Heel strike test**: Worsens leg pain  
- **Rectal examination**: Absent deep sphincter tone, reduced perianal sensation bilaterally, reduced voluntary tone  
- **Plantar reflex/Babinski**: Normal  
- **Clonus test**: Normal
