# Anamnesis – Non-specific Low Back Pain / Lumbar Facet Syndrome

## Chief Complaint
- Localized low back pain, especially during extension and rotation. No leg symptoms.

## Detailed Information
- **Location**: Lower lumbar region, mainly right paraspinal  
- **Pain pattern**: Mechanical pain related to movement and posture  
- **Dominant pain**: Local low back pain – no radiation  
- **Sensation/Strength**: Normal  
- **Pain type**: Dull, cutting pain with certain movements  
- **NRS**: Back 5/10 with activity, 1–2/10 at rest  
- **Onset**: Acute onset 4 months ago after lifting at work – fluctuating course since  
- **Course**: Varies – good and bad days. Worsens with physical load  
- **Diurnal variation**: Worst in the morning and after prolonged sitting  
- **Sleep**: Can find a comfortable position and sleep through the night. Occasionally wakes due to pain when turning  
- **Medication**: Ibuprofen as needed – moderate effect  
- **Past history**: Has had episodes of low back pain before, but not this prolonged  
- **Comorbidities**: None relevant. Non-smoker  
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: No  
- **B-symptoms**: No  

## Activity and Participation
- **Aggravating**: Extension, rotation, heavy lifting, prolonged sitting  
- **Relieving**: Gentle movement, warmth, avoiding provoking positions  
- **Functional loss**: Limitations in physical work, does fewer household tasks  
- **Participation**: Less active in leisure (no running, limited gardening)  
- **Balance issues/Falls**: No  
- **Fine motor skills**: Intact  
- **Treatment**: Has undergone individual physiotherapy with manual joint mobilization and exercises focused on stability and mobility. Also received instruction in home exercises and ergonomics. Effect has been moderate – experiences relief after treatment and generally feels better after exercising, but relapses with excessive load. Tried reflexology with no effect. Uses heating pad and stretching daily, which provides relief. Wants to resume physical activity without “relapsing.”  

## Environmental Factors
- **Home**: Townhouse with stairs  
- **Family**: Married, two children. Supportive spouse  
- **Social**: Has an active network but participates less than before  
- **Occupation**: Warehouse worker – currently on part-time sick leave and in contact with GP and physiotherapist  

## Personal Factors
- **Perception of illness**: Sees it as “wear and tear,” but is motivated to improve  
- **Coping**: Reasonable coping level. Uses active strategies and tries to follow recommendations  
- **Movement behavior**: Actively avoids provoking movements, otherwise physically active  
- **Expectations and goals**: Wants to return to full work and be active with family without constantly compensating for back pain
